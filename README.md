# C++ Mini Projects ![release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/methmal66/cpp-mini-projects)
Mini projects to learn c++. Recommened for students who are follwoing OOC module. Lot of new coor projects are comming soon. It is adviced to use WSL when installing this programs. Because thoese are written inside a Linux environment, targeting linux platforms. Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Sad back story behind this repo üòì
We had a module called OOC (Object Oriented Programming) in our 1st year 2nd sem at SLIIT. It was carried out using C++ as C was taught in the previous sem. The fact i noticed is though students attend lectures, study for exams, do past papers and follow online tutorials they dont seem to have proper understanding about programming. Specially about Object Oriented Design. Students had an illusion that they know enough C++ beacause they were able to complete exercies provied by lecturers. I was also kept in that same cycle. When i wanted to refer some beginner friendly projects to learn the language, that wasnt an easy task. Most of the C++ repos i found on Github is either too complex or too simple. Then i thought to do it my self. But thats not true. We cannot esstimate our programming skills unless our hands get dirty with some real projects. This collection of mini projects will help anyone to esstimate and improve their programming skills, including me obviously.

## How to get the most juice out of this repo üçπ
- Try to read this code base and understand how it works. Some concepts may not familiar to you. Then put some effort to search them online. Try to see the big picture here.
- Try to rebulid this project on your own. Get a basic idea from this code base and make a different version of that, or even a better version.
- Contribute to this repo. Contributing code will help you with programming as well as version controlling. Its the best way to learn prgramming, in my opinion. Contributing instructions are provied [here](CONTRIBUTING.md)
